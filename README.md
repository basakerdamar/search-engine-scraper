# Collection and Analysis of Search Advertisements

This project aims to characterize the search advertisements which appear on the Google search results based on previous behavior of users. 

The idea is to mimic the behaviors of different kinds of search engine users and analyze the search results, specifically advertisements, they encounter for the same queries. 

This project was inspired by existing academic research about filter bubble, but then evolved to be focused on advertisements.
